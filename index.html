                        The purpose of this project was to design an interactive 
                        interface for an emerging startup and gain insight into 
                        the full process of mocking up and designing a solution 
                        to the startup's concept. We decided to create a mobile 
                        prototype for <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lovecast">
                            Lovecast</a>, 
                        an app for celebrating events digitally. Users have the 
                        opportunity to interact and form memories with their 
                        guests, regardless of where they are in the world; from 
                        birthday parties to weddings, the options are truly 
                        endless.

                        Together, we brainstormed a few different design options
                        for the Lovecast app. We focused on three key pages of 
                        this app: the <span>home</span> page, <span>livestream</span>
                        page, and <span>invitations</span> page. We came up 
                        with the following four designs:

                    <p>
                        To acheive Lovecast's goal of <span>hosting various events</span>, 
                        we decided that having <span>event templates</span> on the home 
                        page would make creating events a seamless process for 
                        the user. Furthermore, since "guests can <span>join</span> [these events] 
                        from <span>anywhere in the world</span>," we made use of a clearly laid
                        out <span>invitations page</span> and also featured <span>upcoming events</span>
                        on the home page so they would be easily accessible for 
                        guests. To make the event <span>interactive</span> for all participants, 
                        we included a <span>livestream</span> with a <span>chat box</span> 
                        and <span>emoticon reactions</span>.

                        Before finalizing our hi-fi prototype, we received the 
                        following critiques from our peers to consider:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Increasing the small text, which could've 
                                caused readibility issues for some users
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Increasing the color contrast between the 
                                originally light pink button on top of the 
                                purple background 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Having the chat box in the livestream be 
                                collapsable
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Making the "Create Your Own Event" template 
                                stand out more 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Making the Pre-Stream Checklist icons more 
                                apparent that they should be clicked on   
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Putting the "Upload your own image" option 
                                before the built-in photos, since it makes more 
                                sense for users to add their own photos for 
                                personal events  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Including both a "Join" and "Details" button 
                                for events that are about to start, as opposed 
                                to just "Join"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Adding clarity to the fact that more guests 
                                can be invited to an event 
                            </li>

                    <p>
                        Taking our peers' critiques into consideration, we 
                        updated our hi-fi prototype. A video demo of our 
                        prototype is as follows:
                        <div class="hifi">
                            <video controls>
                                <source src="./hifi.mov">

                    </p>

                <h3><span>
                    USER TESTING
                </span></h3>
                <div class="section-body">
                    <p>
                        <p class="sub-p">
                            We then went through a second round of feedback by 
                            submitting our updated prototype to UserTesting, where 
                            three testers would complete a task and provide 
                            feedback on how the process went for them.
                        </p>

                        <p class="sub-p">
                            The first task was to <span>start the Tea Party</span> event. None 
                            of the three testers had trouble finding the "Start" 
                            button and clicking the "Go Live" button. They all 
                            rated the task as 5 (very easy). This was in line with 
                            our expectations since we intentionally made the "Start" 
                            button for the upcoming events green and right below the 
                            event name so that it was easy for users to recognize 
                            and find.
                        </p>


                        <p class="sub-p">
                            The next task was to <span>check that the camera, audio, 
                            and connection settings work</span>. Users were able to successfully 
                            open the popup for each setting and also all rated the 
                            task as 5 (very easy). This matched our expectations 
                            since we had icons as buttons that represented each 
                            setting option, along with text labeling the setting 
                            so users would have a smooth experience understanding 
                            and adjusting the appropriate settings.
                        </p>

                        <p class="sub-p">
                            The last task was to <span>end the stream</span>. All users were able 
                            to quickly find the "Exit Stream" button and leave the 
                            page. All testers rated the task as 5 (very easy). This 
                            aligned with our expectations because we made the 
                            "Exit Stream" button red and at the top left of the screen, 
                            where people generally expect quit buttons, so they can 
                            easily exit the stream. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Based on just our UserTesting results and 
                            feedback, we wouldn't change much about our interface, 
                            as all users gave positive feedback and didn't have any 
                            struggles. There was no unexpected behavior. The 
                            unnecessary clicks that users made (if any) were only 
                            due to the fact that they were given a Figma mockup, 
                            which users on this site aren't used to experiencing. 
                            This resulted in users trying to click on buttons that 
                            we never added functionality to, so the next step 
                            would likely be adding more screens and 
                            interactive windows to the mockup.

                        Designing the Lovecast app gave us the opportunity to 
                        not only explore various design choices, but also 
                        improve upon our first iteration of our prototype based 
                        on the feedback we received. There are many nuances that 
                        come with creating an intuitive interface for users,
                        making it imperative to thoroughly test a design
